## Geoclustering

Picture this: you have a **massive greenfield** to farm for electricity, be it for your offtaker or or a [P2X project](https://orsted.com/en/what-we-do/renewable-energy-solutions/power-to-x). You need to get the most of it while balancing cost.

You will want to:
- Place your assets efficiently
- Connect them in the optimal way

Only then will you have a foundation to perform detail engineering.

This demo does exactly that:
